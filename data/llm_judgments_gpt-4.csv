I won't be able to submit all the materials required by [Deadline] - does it make any sense to submit later?  I attach the short version of my abstract below and will provide the rest of the materials by the original deadline.

I hope that it will still be possible for me to present my work with you at [deadline].

"What's something fun you did last weekend?","I'm feeling pretty exhausted right now, but I'll do my best to answer your question. Last weekend, I went hiking with some friends and enjoyed the beautiful fall weather. It was a nice break from the usual routine.","gpt3.5","human","The response includes personal experiences and emotions, such as feeling exhausted and going hiking with friends, which are typically human characteristics. An AI does not have personal experiences or emotions.","gpt-4","unknown"

"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","A binary search algorithm is a method used in computer science to find a specific value in a sorted array or list. It operates by dividing the array into two halves, determining which half the desired value is in, and then repeating the process on that half. This continues until the value is found or all elements have been examined.","gpt4","ai","The response is accurate, concise, and devoid of any personal touch or anecdotal references that are common in human responses. It seems to be generated by an AI trained in technical language comprehension.","gpt-4","educational"
"Is it better to be happy or to know the truth?","It is better to know the truth so you can overcome it and move on with your life. Staying depressed because of a disappointing truth is useless and does nobody any good. We experience things to help us grow, if something bad is thrown your way then just pick yourself, dust yourself off and keep walking on. You'll be stronger than you were before the obstacle came your way.","human","human","The response contains personal pronouns and emotional language that is typically associated with human writing. It also includes idiomatic expressions like ""pick yourself, dust yourself off"" which AI doesn't usually generate.","gpt-4","philosophical"
"How would you define multiplication using addition?","It's basically adding the same number over and over.

AI responses are typically more formal and precise.","gpt-4","educational"
"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","Oh man, that's deep. Maybe we're all just floating in a meaningless void and nothing we do really matters. Or maybe it's all about the journey and not the destination. Who knows? Let's ponder the mysteries of existence over some pizza.","gpt3.5","human","The response contains casual language, humor, and a suggestion for a social activity (eating pizza), which are all indicative of a human response. It also shows a level of introspection and existential questioning that AI currently lacks.","gpt-4","philosophical"
"Rewrite this sentence to sound more formal: I messed up the report.","I regret to inform that there has been a misinterpretation in the preparation of the report.","gpt4","ai","The response is overly formal and uses the term ""misinterpretation"" which doesn't exactly match the original meaning of ""messed up"". A human would likely use a phrase more closely related to making a mistake. This suggests an AI may have written the response.","gpt-4","unknown"
"Rewrite this sentence to sound more formal: I messed up the report.","I regret to inform you that I have made an error in the report.","gpt3.5","ai","The response is perfectly formal and error-free, which is more typical of an AI.

AI might not have personal experiences or emotions to draw upon for such a response.","gpt-4","philosophical"
"I had a fight with a close friend â€” should I apologize even if I wasn't wrong?","Eh, depends on how much you value the friendship. If they're being stubborn, maybe throw them a peace offering like a pizza or something. Or just wait it out until they come crawling back to you. Remember, life's too short for unnecessary drama!","gpt3.5","human","The response contains casual language and colloquial expressions (""Eh,"" ""throw them a peace offering,"" ""come crawling back"") that are typically human.

"Rewrite this sentence to sound more formal: I messed up the report.","I have made a mistake in the report i worked on.","human","ai","The response lacks the use of proper punctuation and capitalization, which is a common issue in AI-generated text. Furthermore, the phrase ""I worked on"" is redundant and a human would likely omit it for conciseness.","gpt-4","unknown"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","Well, imagine you're looking for your favorite pair of socks in a drawer. Instead of checking every single sock one by one, you split the drawer in half and see if your socks are in the left or right side. Then you keep splitting until you find them. It's like a game of hot and cold, but with numbers instead of socks!","gpt3.5","human","The response uses a casual and relatable analogy, which is a typical human approach to explain complex concepts. The language used is informal and conversational, suggesting a human author.","gpt-4","educational"
"I'm torn between a high-paying job I dislike and one I enjoy. What should I do?","This is what I would do: I would stick to a higher paying job if my personal, financial, or family circumstances absolutely require that I gather a certain amount of wealth every year. Without such constraints, I would choose a job I would enjoy and one that would eventually take me on a career path that pays well.
That said, we all need to make informed choices based on our individual circumstances. Dont rush! Think well and make the right choice.","human","human","The response shows a level of personal reflection and empathy that is typically associated with human responses. It also uses phrases like ""This is what I would do"" and ""Dont rush! Think well and make the right choice"" which suggest human authorship.","gpt-4","unknown"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","Oh, binary search? It's like playing a guessing game with a perfectly organized closet. You start in the middle and keep halving the possibilities until you find what you're looking for. It's like the Marie Kondo of algorithms  keeping things tidy and efficient. So, think of it as the nerdy way of finding your favorite pair of socks in a chaotic sock drawer.","gpt3.5","human","The response uses a lot of informal language and metaphors, which are more typical of human communication. The reference to Marie Kondo, a popular culture figure, also suggests a human author. AI typically provides more technical and formal explanations.","gpt-4","educational"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","Binary search algorithm quickly locates a value in a sorted dataset by repeatedly dividing the dataset in half until the value is found.

It also lacks the complex sentence structures and advanced vocabulary that AI often uses.","gpt-4","educational"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","A binary search algorithm is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and continues narrowing down the search space until the target value is found or determined to be not in the array. This algorithm is efficient for searching in large datasets as it eliminates half of the remaining elements in each iteration.","gpt3.5","ai","The response is very structured and precise, with no personal language or colloquialisms.

"Rewrite this sentence to sound more formal: I messed up the report.","I regretfully acknowledge that there have been inaccuracies in the execution of the report.","gpt4","ai","The response is overly formal and uses more complex language than a human typically would in a casual or professional setting. This suggests it was likely generated by an AI.","gpt-4","unknown"
"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","Yes, they still matter. Actions shape who we are as individuals, regardless of anyone remembering.","gpt4","human","The response has a philosophical and introspective tone, which is more typical of human responses. While AI can mimic this to some extent, the depth of understanding and personal reflection in the response suggests a human author.","gpt-4","philosophical"

AI typically lacks the ability to express personal preferences or humor in the same way.","gpt-4","philosophical"
"How would you define multiplication using addition?","Hey, multiplication using addition is basically a shortcut for adding the same number multiple times.

"I had a fight with a close friend â€” should I apologize even if I wasn't wrong?","It's always tough when fights happen, especially with close friends. But sometimes, saying sorry isn't about admitting you're wrong, it's about valuing the relationship more than your ego.","gpt4","human","The response shows a deep understanding of human emotions and relationships, which is currently beyond the capabilities of AI.

I will tell you a story of the only case when the person had no part in the incident, it was a Friday night and my son and one of his friends and his father went to eat pizza. When they came out two young 30ish age cowboys were sitting in a pickup truck. When they walked past the cowboys the cowboy next to the door slapped my sons friend. No reason he just thought it would be a good idea. Oh boy you can imagine how crazy the father went. The boys had to drag the father away from there.

I say go with the high-paying job and use the money to buy things that make you happy, like a massage chair or a pet sloth. Or follow your passion and live off ramen noodles and dreams. Either way, just make sure to treat yourself to some ice cream every now and then.

"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","Unless you have some sort of religion, I think there is none. It doesn't matter how important you were in life or how many people you influenced or loved, once you die you become irrelevant for the most part. The people who loved you are left behind and broken, but in time most of them will move on. The ones that can't, will eventually die themselves, one way or another, as will everyone else who really knew you. Some will even forget you. Eventually you will be nobody, like all the other people that have come before. It's quite depressing really.
I grew up with Christianity. I had doubts from a young age, but being born into it, I still followed it. When my dog died unexpectedly, I was angry at God. It was an outlet I guess. Then with my beloved grandfather a few years later, I prayed so hard for him to survive. He didn't. Again I was angry, but I also knew my grandfather was an exceptionally good person. If anyone would get into heaven, it would surely be him. It made coping a little easier I think. To think maybe he was still out there somewhere. That there is life after death.
Years later I started to leave religion behind. I haven't lost anyone since, but I can now see why religion exists. It gives people a way to deal with the worst part of life: death. Your own and that of your loved ones and pets etc. Without it, you are confronted with the reality of existence in my opinion. When someone dies, they are gone. They only survive in memories for a time. That's it.
You could try and create meaning for yourself, but that's up to you. Personally, I just focus on my loved ones and their happiness as far as possible. That's the only thing that makes me feel a little better.","human","human","The response contains personal experiences and emotions, which are currently beyond the capabilities of AI.

"I had a fight with a close friend â€” should I apologize even if I wasn't wrong?","I think the wrongness or rightness of your apology depends on your motive. If you're outwardly apologizing, but inwardly you have a certain smugness about being the bigger person, or if after the apology you have a certain resentment for that person that could even turn out to be ongoing, then I would say it's wrong to apologize. It's not beneficial for the other person, or for you.
Where it would be -not wrong- to make an apology, even if you don't think you're in the wrong, is to find something that you can honestly apologize for. I think that, usually, in the case of all humans, it's kind of easy to do this. If you're already in an argument, there probably is something that you can honestly apologize for. For example, Look, I'm sorry. I think I started to be sarcastic, because I was getting frustrated. I'm sorry. Or, Look, I think I came across as harsh and I apologize for that. That wasn't what I wanted to do. I'm sorry. So if you can apologize for something like that, something you honestly feel sorry about, I think that's the way to go. And that way, you can remain true to yourself, and be completely honest with that other person. You're not apologizing for the thing that you know you didn't do wrong, yet you're willing to genuinely concede something, in a respectful way that takes them and their feelings into consideration.","human","human","The response demonstrates a nuanced understanding of human emotions and social dynamics.

If you do linear search, then you end up reading every single word, in order, until you get to the word that you're looking for. If you do a binary search, you flip to the middle of the dictionary, and repeat this on halves. Everyone does this intuitively  it's binary search.","human","human","The response includes a personal perspective (""Everyone does this intuitively"") and uses an informal, conversational tone.

"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","Yes, I believe that even if no one remembers my actions, they still matter. Every action has a ripple effect, whether it's acknowledged or not. It's important to do the right thing for the sake of personal integrity, regardless of recognition. So, yes, I think my actions still hold significance even if they go unnoticed by others.","gpt3.5","human","The response contains personal pronouns and emotions, which are typically associated with human responses.

"Rewrite this sentence to sound more formal: I messed up the report.","I regret to inform you that I made an error in the preparation of the report.","gpt4","ai","While a human could certainly have written this response, it is more likely to be an AI due to the formal and somewhat excessive politeness.

"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","I don't think what I am about to say is what you want to hear. I will say it anyway, as it may change your perspective.
Yes, it is important that you care, and also get really excited about what you do, and can do for yourself and others.
The whole point of life is to enjoy it, or at the very least make the most of right now wherever you are. It doesnt matter what happened in the past and what will happen in the future. All that resides, and gets magnified in the mind only, and it is irrelevant and meaningless right now. Think about it.
Here's a question you need to consider: What difference does it make what happens eventually and after you die? Be honest, why do you care so much? While you do that, bear in mind that it is the ego that fears death which seeks to survive after death. What is really sad, is that in its desperate attempt to ""survive"" after death, it can drag you into a severe state of depression while you are alive.
I want to say you are wasting your limited time here and now focusing on stuff that is truly pointless and meaningless.
Yes, care about what you do now. Why? Because the primary purpose of your life is about you and its not about leaving some deposit or creating a memorial for yourself in the vain hope that someone will honor the life you never honored for yourself. I wish you would realise you are here to expand, create and enjoy your life in every way possible. If you can also be a blessing to others, that too will enhance your own life- in the moment. Life is about your journey and how interesting you make it to yourself. Anything left behind should be seen as a bonus; a by product that remains totally unnecessary to you while alive.
The vast majority of people live and die without anyone remembering them and if people do, they remember tiny inconsequential specs of their lives. So what? No big deal really. Do you think the dead care? Im sure you know you know all that but perhaps don't wish to think about it...
I will finish with suggesting you can benefit from a change in perspective. A good happy fun life isnt about labels, achievements and awards. Learn to appreciate and enjoy the moment right now.
I don't know if you want change or if you want someone to agree with you now. But, if you truly want change, research the topic and watch videos online that will help redirect your current mindset and enable you to enjoy life so much more.
