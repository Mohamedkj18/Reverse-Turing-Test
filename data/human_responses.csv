"Is it better to be happy or to know the truth?","I would rather know the straight truth than chase a lie in circles. Humanity is already chasing its own lie (tail) in circles confused as to why we have troubles, depression etc blaming everybody else. It‚Äôs Politics no it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs them!","human"
"Is it better to be happy or to know the truth?","I've always said I would much rather know the truth and be unhappy than live a lie. Unhappiness can be dealt with as you find inner validation and happiness in yourself. Real life is just fun. Lies are just wrong.","human"
"Is it better to be happy or to know the truth?","hmmm‚Ä¶ well, maybe unhappy for a little. At least you‚Äôll get closure from what you had thought was true and you‚Äôll feel relieved to not feel ‚Äústupid‚Äù anymore for believing in whatever it was. Knowing the truth will guide you in the better direction most of the time.","human"
"Is it better to be happy or to know the truth?","In general, it is better to know the truth, even if it may be difficult or upsetting, because knowledge and understanding can help us to make informed decisions and to cope with difficult situations. However, there may be times when it is appropriate to protect ourselves from certain kinds of information if it would be overly distressing or overwhelming. The decision to seek out information or to avoid it will depend on the specific circumstances and the individual's needs and abilities.","human"
"Is it better to be happy or to know the truth?","It is better to know the truth so you can overcome it and move on with your life. Staying depressed because of a disappointing truth is useless and does nobody any good. We experience things to help us grow, if something bad is thrown your way then just pick yourself, dust yourself off and keep walking on. You'll be stronger than you were before the obstacle came your way.","human"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.","human"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","Binary Search Principle: Divide and Conquer. To be more accurate, reduce (kill the irrelevants) and conquer. Problem: You want to find something (you know how that something looks) from a lot of possible candidates. Solution: How nice would it be if you could reject half of the candidates right away, only if you knew that they could never look like what you are looking for.","human"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","A good analogy is to think about looking up a word in the dictionary (a paper dictionary, not an online dictionary). If you do linear search, then you end up reading every single word, in order, until you get to the word that you're looking for. If you do a binary search, you flip to the middle of the dictionary, and repeat this on halves. Everyone does this intuitively ‚Äî it's binary search.","human"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","Suppose you're in class and your teacher asks you to turn to page 70. You open a random page. If it‚Äôs below 70, you know to check to the right; if above, then to the left. You eliminate half of the possibilities. That‚Äôs how binary search works.","human"
"Explain the concept of a binary search algorithm.","In a sorted list, binary search lets you ignore half the list at each step, leading to a time complexity of O(logN), compared to linear search which is O(N).","human"
"How would you define multiplication using addition?","If we add either the multiplicand as many times as the multiplier, we get the same result as the multiplication.","human"
"How would you define multiplication using addition?","Multiplication, in a way, can be viewed as repeated addition. It's basically the same thing, but much faster.","human"

"What kind of music do you like to listen to when you're relaxing?","Opera and classical music.","human"
"What kind of music do you like to listen to when you're relaxing?","At times of relaxing I listen basically these 2 varieties of music: House or Deep House Music by Kygo; Traditional Chinese/ Japanese music","human"

"Write a short email requesting an extension for a project deadline.","Hi Tom:
The deadline for the Bingham ad copy is tomorrow at noon. I hope you can grant me an extension until 5 p.m. I‚Äôm sorry to miss the deadline, but my back right molar broke and the only time I can get into the dentist to have it fixed is tomorrow morning. I will move heaven and earth to meet the new deadline when I get in after the appointment.
A rough draft of the ad is with the client and I expect an email response first thing tomorrow. I don‚Äôt anticipate a problem, but there should be plenty of time to make any changes once I return to the office. Designers have a copy to comp the ad with, too.
This is the first deadline I will have missed and I feel terrible about missing it. Thank you for your patience and working with me on this short but unfortunate delay.
With thanks,

"I had a fight with a close friend ‚Äî should I apologize even if I wasn‚Äôt wrong?","Ok so me and my sister have this happen at least once every three months.
I refuse to bend to her when it comes to the argument, usually because she comes at me very rudely, and I end up losing my temper just enough to say something a little rude but never personal.
she‚Äôll always go personal.
when she‚Äôs cooled off, and when I‚Äôve had time to think, one of us will call the other, more often than not her first.
she will apologize for her behavior and admit that I was right eventually. I apologize for my behavior and say ‚Äúeven if I was right or wrong I shouldn‚Äôt have don‚Äôt x, y, and h‚Äù. Then we crack a joke and patch it up.
even if you were right, there is a real chance you may have hurt their feelings as well, and you should consider them when you reflect before your apology. Make sure you think about things from their perspective as well as yours.
I hope this helps üôÇ","human"
"I had a fight with a close friend ‚Äî should I apologize even if I wasn‚Äôt wrong?","I think the wrongness or rightness of your apology depends on your motive. If you're outwardly apologizing, but inwardly you have a certain smugness about being ‚Äúthe bigger person‚Äù, or if after the apology you have a certain resentment for that person that could even turn out to be ongoing, then I would say it's wrong to apologize. It's not beneficial for the other person, or for you.
Where it would be -not wrong- to make an apology, even if you don't think you're in the wrong, is to find something that you can honestly apologize for. I think that, usually, in the case of all humans, it's kind of easy to do this. If you're already in an argument, there probably is something that you can honestly apologize for. For example, ‚ÄúLook, I'm sorry. I think I started to be sarcastic, because I was getting frustrated. I'm sorry.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúLook, I think I came across as harsh and I apologize for that. That wasn't what I wanted to do. I'm sorry.‚Äù So if you can apologize for something like that, something you honestly feel sorry about, I think that's the way to go. And that way, you can remain true to yourself, and be completely honest with that other person. You're not apologizing for the thing that you know you didn't do wrong, yet you're willing to genuinely concede something, in a respectful way that takes them and their feelings into consideration.","human"
"I had a fight with a close friend ‚Äî should I apologize even if I wasn‚Äôt wrong?","Hello there. It‚Äôs hard to answer your question for me without more information. For me I tend to apologize for my part in anything to keep my side of the street clean. Then I‚Äôm through with it. But I don‚Äôt automatically apologize, I have to think about it, look back at what happened and see what part was mine. Very few FIGHTS START WITHOUT BOTH PEOPLE HAVING A PART IN IT! There you have my belief. I have rarely apologized immediately, unless I could see right then that I had been a jackass then I have stepped up and said so. But other times it has taken a long time. I,forself, have to eventually make things right if I know I have hurt someone especially if it‚Äôs someone I love that I have hurt. To be honest I wasn‚Äôt very good at this when I was young. Age will beat it into you if nothing else.üòÄ I will tell you a story of the only case when the person had no part in the incident, it was a Friday night and my son and one of his friends and his father went to eat pizza. When they came out two young 30ish age cowboys were sitting in a pickup truck. When they walked past the cowboys the cowboy next to the door slapped my sons friend. No reason he just thought it would be a good idea. Oh boy you can imagine how crazy the father went. The boys had to drag the father away from there. I think those cowboys started Friday a little early. So..you get my point. The young man that got slapped had nothing to apologize for. Boy I had a lot to say for a lady that started with I don‚Äôt how to answer. Good luck.","human"
"I had a fight with a close friend ‚Äî should I apologize even if I wasn‚Äôt wrong?","Sort of . You can postpone it by saying something like, ‚Äúyou know, I‚Äôm really sorry that we‚Äôre arguing like this. It‚Äôs terrible because we should be enjoying each other‚Äôs company rather than beating this thing to a pulp. Why not say we give it a rest for a couple weeks. Think of something else to do for a while and re-visit this with clearer heads then?‚Äù
If its a worthy argument, then it will come back up. If it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs will be forgotten about in two weeks.","human"
""I had a fight with a close friend ‚Äî should I apologize even if I wasn't wrong?"I had a fight with a close friend ‚Äî should I apologize even if I wasn‚Äôt wrong?","I dont see anything wrong if you wanted to apologize even if you dont think that you are wrong.Apology doesn‚Äôt mean you are weak,it means your strong enough to let go of the matter and choose that person or someone by letting them know that you value them more than anything.
I seldom apologize myself,but my partner taught me how important it is to value relationship and people,sacrifice and compromising at the same time.
So go on and apologize,nothing to worry about it","human"
"I'm torn between a high-paying job I dislike and one I enjoy. What should I do?","I once asked the doctor my mom was the head nurse for this exact question.
I was doing my third of four clinicals to get my RN. I was not happy and hated working with doctors that all wanted to be treated like a god. I don‚Äôt kiss ass and I grew up with a family full of doctors and nurses so I was over their god complex early in life.
I hated nursing but was pushed into it by my family.
I talked to my moms boss and he told me to do what makes me happy. He left his family‚Äôs business to be a doctor later in life.
He resented everyone around him for not being happy.
Sometimes you can learn to budget to be happy.
If you are in a relationship talk to your partner and work out a plan that works for your family.
If you are single do what makes you happy. Money doesn‚Äôt make people happy, living a life with purpose and enjoyment does.
Good luck!","human"
"I'm torn between a high-paying job I dislike and one I enjoy. What should I do?","Best is to do what is needed from time to time
Next best is to do what one likes to do irrespective of what one gets out of it
These are the only two options. Doing what one doesn't like is for fools. Why should one do it?
But what about money? Well, money get you comforts and luxury, but is that at the top of your priority list? If so, go for it, else go to the top of the answer.
Thanks","human"
"I'm torn between a high-paying job I dislike and one I enjoy. What should I do?","This is what I would do: I would stick to a higher paying job if my personal, financial, or family circumstances absolutely require that I gather a certain amount of wealth every year. Without such constraints, I would choose a job I would enjoy and one that would eventually take me on a career path that pays well.
That said, we all need to make informed choices based on our individual circumstances. Don‚Äôt rush! Think well and make the right choice.","human"
"I'm torn between a high-paying job I dislike and one I enjoy. What should I do?","It's better to stick with the higher paying job when the difference between the two allows you to retire earlier and better support those you love. If the difference is small, go for the job you'll enjoy‚Ä¶but be fully aware that the enjoyment might fade if you find yourself short of money.","human"
"I'm torn between a high-paying job I dislike and one I enjoy. What should I do?","That is strictly a personal preference. My brother and I have discussed this question before. I always said I prefer to work a possibly lower paying job doing a job that I love. He said if shoveling shxt paid a lot he'd rather do that. There is a fine line. I want to do something I love doing, but I have to be able to support myself.","human"
"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","this is rubbish. according to the laws of science no energy will ever get lost. so
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
will influence further times","human"
"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","Not true. Everything we do affects everything in the future. If we don't make a name for ourselves people might not remember us, but the things we did in our lifetime undoubtedly have an effect on the future.","human"
"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","This is a garbage shower thought. Maybe people won‚Äôt remember you, but do you know your ancestors from 1000 years ago? Does that mean you don‚Äôt matter? Clearly their actions had meaningful impacts on the future, just look in the mirror. It‚Äôs reasonable to assume your descendants will have the same reflections...","human"
"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","Unless you have some sort of religion, I think there is none. It doesn't matter how important you were in life or how many people you influenced or loved, once you die you become irrelevant for the most part. The people who loved you are left behind and broken, but in time most of them will move on. The ones that can't, will eventually die themselves, one way or another, as will everyone else who really knew you. Some will even forget you. Eventually you will be nobody, like all the other people that have come before. It's quite depressing really.
I grew up with Christianity. I had doubts from a young age, but being born into it, I still followed it. When my dog died unexpectedly, I was angry at God. It was an outlet I guess. Then with my beloved grandfather a few years later, I prayed so hard for him to survive. He didn't. Again I was angry, but I also knew my grandfather was an exceptionally good person. If anyone would get into heaven, it would surely be him. It made coping a little easier I think. To think maybe he was still out there somewhere. That there is life after death.
Years later I started to leave religion behind. I haven't lost anyone since, but I can now see why religion exists. It gives people a way to deal with the worst part of life: death. Your own and that of your loved ones and pets etc. Without it, you are confronted with the reality of existence in my opinion. When someone dies, they are gone. They only survive in memories for a time. That's it.
You could try and create meaning for yourself, but that's up to you. Personally, I just focus on my loved ones and their happiness as far as possible. That's the only thing that makes me feel a little better.","human"
"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","I don't think what I am about to say is what you want to hear. I will say it anyway, as it may change your perspective.
Yes, it is important that you care, and also get really excited about what you do, and can do for yourself and others.
The whole point of life is to enjoy it, or at the very least make the most of right now wherever you are. It doesn‚Äôt matter what happened in the past and what will happen in the future. All that resides, and gets magnified in the mind only, and it is irrelevant and meaningless right now. Think about it.
Here's a question you need to consider: What difference does it make what happens ‚Äúeventually‚Äù and after you die? Be honest, why do you care so much? While you do that, bear in mind that it is the ego that fears death which seeks to survive after death. What is really sad, is that in its desperate attempt to ""survive"" after death, it can drag you into a severe state of depression while you are alive.
I want to say you are wasting your limited time here and now focusing on stuff that is truly pointless and meaningless.
Yes, care about what you do now. Why? Because the primary purpose of your life is about you and it‚Äôs not about leaving some deposit or creating a memorial for yourself in the vain hope that someone will honor the life you never honored for yourself. I wish you would realise you are here to expand, create and enjoy your life in every way possible. If you can also be a blessing to others, that too will enhance your own life- in the moment. Life is about your journey and how interesting you make it to yourself. Anything left behind should be seen as a bonus; a by product that remains totally unnecessary to you while alive.
The vast majority of people live and die without anyone remembering them and if people do, they remember tiny inconsequential specs of their lives. So what? No big deal really. Do you think the dead care? Im sure you know you know all that but perhaps don't wish to think about it...
I will finish with suggesting you can benefit from a change in perspective. A good happy fun life isn‚Äôt about labels, achievements and awards. Learn to appreciate and enjoy the moment right now.
I don't know if you want change or if you want someone to agree with you now. But, if you truly want change, research the topic and watch videos online that will help redirect your current mindset and enable you to enjoy life so much more.
