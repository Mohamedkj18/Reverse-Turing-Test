No reason he just thought it would be a good idea. Oh boy you can imagine how crazy the father went. The boys had to drag the father away from there.

"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","Unless you have some sort of religion, I think there is none. It doesn't matter how important you were in life or how many people you influenced or loved, once you die you become irrelevant for the most part. The people who loved you are left behind and broken, but in time most of them will move on. The ones that can't, will eventually die themselves, one way or another, as will everyone else who really knew you. Some will even forget you. Eventually you will be nobody, like all the other people that have come before. It's quite depressing really.
I grew up with Christianity. I had doubts from a young age, but being born into it, I still followed it. When my dog died unexpectedly, I was angry at God. It was an outlet I guess. Then with my beloved grandfather a few years later, I prayed so hard for him to survive. He didn't. Again I was angry, but I also knew my grandfather was an exceptionally good person. If anyone would get into heaven, it would surely be him. It made coping a little easier I think. To think maybe he was still out there somewhere. That there is life after death.
Years later I started to leave religion behind. I haven't lost anyone since, but I can now see why religion exists. It gives people a way to deal with the worst part of life: death. Your own and that of your loved ones and pets etc. Without it, you are confronted with the reality of existence in my opinion. When someone dies, they are gone. They only survive in memories for a time. That's it.

"I had a fight with a close friend — should I apologize even if I wasn't wrong?","I think the wrongness or rightness of your apology depends on your motive. If you're outwardly apologizing, but inwardly you have a certain smugness about being “the bigger person”, or if after the apology you have a certain resentment for that person that could even turn out to be ongoing, then I would say it's wrong to apologize. It's not beneficial for the other person, or for you.
Where it would be -not wrong- to make an apology, even if you don't think you're in the wrong, is to find something that you can honestly apologize for. I think that, usually, in the case of all humans, it's kind of easy to do this. If you're already in an argument, there probably is something that you can honestly apologize for. For example, “Look, I'm sorry. I think I started to be sarcastic, because I was getting frustrated. I'm sorry.” Or, “Look, I think I came across as harsh and I apologize for that. That wasn't what I wanted to do. I'm sorry.” So if you can apologize for something like that, something you honestly feel sorry about, I think that's the way to go. And that way, you can remain true to yourself, and be completely honest with that other person. You're not apologizing for the thing that you know you didn't do wrong, yet you're willing to genuinely concede something, in a respectful way that takes them and their feelings into consideration.",human,human,"The response shows a nuanced understanding of human emotions and relationships, providing thoughtful advice based on empathy and personal experience.

"If no one remembers your actions, do they still matter?","I don't think what I am about to say is what you want to hear. I will say it anyway, as it may change your perspective.
Yes, it is important that you care, and also get really excited about what you do, and can do for yourself and others.
The whole point of life is to enjoy it, or at the very least make the most of right now wherever you are. It doesn’t matter what happened in the past and what will happen in the future. All that resides, and gets magnified in the mind only, and it is irrelevant and meaningless right now. Think about it.
Here's a question you need to consider: What difference does it make what happens “eventually” and after you die? Be honest, why do you care so much? While you do that, bear in mind that it is the ego that fears death which seeks to survive after death. What is really sad, is that in its desperate attempt to ""survive"" after death, it can drag you into a severe state of depression while you are alive.
I want to say you are wasting your limited time here and now focusing on stuff that is truly pointless and meaningless.
Yes, care about what you do now. Why? Because the primary purpose of your life is about you and it’s not about leaving some deposit or creating a memorial for yourself in the vain hope that someone will honor the life you never honored for yourself. I wish you would realise you are here to expand, create and enjoy your life in every way possible. If you can also be a blessing to others, that too will enhance your own life- in the moment. Life is about your journey and how interesting you make it to yourself. Anything left behind should be seen as a bonus; a by product that remains totally unnecessary to you while alive.
The vast majority of people live and die without anyone remembering them and if people do, they remember tiny inconsequential specs of their lives. So what? No big deal really. Do you think the dead care? Im sure you know you know all that but perhaps don't wish to think about it...
I will finish with suggesting you can benefit from a change in perspective. A good happy fun life isn’t about labels, achievements and awards. Learn to appreciate and enjoy the moment right now.
I don't know if you want change or if you want someone to agree with you now. But, if you truly want change, research the topic and watch videos online that will help redirect your current mindset and enable you to enjoy life so much more.
